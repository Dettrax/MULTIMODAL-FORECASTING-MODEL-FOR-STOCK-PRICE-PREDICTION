# MULTIMODAL-FORECASTING-MODEL-FOR-STOCK-PRICE-PREDICTION

DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED A SOPHISTICATED FORECASTING MODEL COMBINING TRADITIONAL TIME SERIES ANALYSIS 
TECHNIQUES LIKE ARIMA AND GARCH WITH CUTTING-EDGE DEEP LEARNING ARCHITECTURES SUCH AS CNN ATTENTIONBASED LSTM. INTEGRATED THE SELECTIVE SPACE ALGORITHM (MAMBA) TO OPTIMIZE FEATURE SELECTION AND REDUCE 
COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY. LEVERAGED XGBOOST FOR FINE- AND ENSEMBLE LEARNING TO ENHANCE PREDICTIVE 
ACCURACY AND ROBUSTNESS. THE MODEL DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE IN PREDICTING STOCK PRICES,
OFFERING VALUABLE INSIGHTS FOR INVESTMENT DECISION-MAKING. THIS PROJECT UNDERSCORES A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO 
FINANCIAL FORECASTING BY LEVERAGING DIVERSE METHODOLOGIES AND ADVANCED ALGORITHMS
